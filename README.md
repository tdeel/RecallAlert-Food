Recall Alert: Food Safety provides consumers with easy access to relevant information about food recalls in their area.  
Today, consumers can get an email newsletter of recalls from the FDA which doesn’t account for where users live to determine relevance of the recall.  Food recall information is generally publicized through the media only when there is a significant health risk.  At the local level, information is sometimes posted as paper flyers in grocery stores.
The Recall Alert design prototype represents one 9-day sprint of research, design and development using user-centered design and lean UX processes to create an MVP product release that addresses real unmet user needs and that testing shows is a usable and valuable web application.           
MVP Release:  Provide consumers an easy way to search by location/ distribution area of food that is recalled to determine if they may be impacted. 

Future enhancements may include: Enable consumers to search by local food outlets to determine if there is a product recall that impacts them.

Overview: User-Centered Design Approach
User Research – To get quick results, the team launched an online survey and user interviews to more deeply understand concerns around food recalls, how consumers are getting information now, and to understand their goals for food recalls.    
Highlights from the User Experience Strategy Guide include:  
•	Site should leverage location to proactively inform users of recalls in their area 
•	Information should be precise and contain information that makes it easy to understand if the product is something they have purchase or consumed. Search result information should be displayed based on user needs:   
o	Product name
o	Reason for recall
o	Severity of health risk
o	Product identifier for food impacted by recall i.e. lot number, sell-by-date
o	Date the recall began
o	Whether the recall was voluntary or mandated by the FDA
•	Consumers rank the following as most important to see and search by:  
o	Product name
o	Product manufacturer
o	Product type
•	In addition to information about the product recall, it should help users navigate what action to take, if any.


Rapid low-fidelity prototyping - With knowledge of users’ goals and an understanding of their mental model, the team moved into rapid low-fidelity prototyping using Axure to explore interaction design, workflow, navigation and content.  The team designed a responsive UI for three separate screen size break points: desktop (1200), tablet (768) and mobile (320).  The team iterated the low-fidelity prototype through multiple design reviews with internal stakeholders.  Design reviews provided feedback to refine the prototype before user testing.            
User testing – Within days of beginning the process, the team conducted 1:1 task-based usability testing with consumers using the clickable Axure prototype. Testing was conducted on desktop and mobile views.  Data from task success/failure, and user feedback produced these key findings: 
1.	Users were most interested in recalls that impacted their state regionally, not for a full list of recalls for the entire state.  Design recommendation: Continue to look for ways to track distribution beyond by state.  
2.	Users wanting to search by state and by product/keywords at same time.  Design recommendation:  Revise the design so both search options can be used in unison.
3.	Users were interested in seeing a picture of the product to help them identify at a glance if they had the recalled item.   Recommendation: Consider including an image of the item along with the description. 
4.	Users indicated they would use the site if they were familiar with it, or if it returned via Google search.  They would be more likely to choose this if it returns higher in the results list. Recommendation: SEO optimization is a must.
Future Enhancements 
•	Consumers are interested in contacting the manufacturers or retailers directly from this site; listing the contact information would be helpful.
Visual design – After finalizing interaction design and functionality for the v1 sprint, the team explored visual design and branding through Style Tiles.   Visual and interaction design style guides explored important visual design and branding anchors including logo, color palette, fonts, and layout grid for the responsive site.  Interaction and visual style guides were generated for development teams to follow.  
Front-end development – Following interaction design and visual design style guidelines, the front-end developers build the UI to meet functional and design specifications.   The UI is coded in Foundation, an open source, mobile-first, semantic code based on 12-column grid system.  The site uses HTML, CSS and Javascript on top of the Foundation framework.
